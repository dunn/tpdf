tpdf version 0.03

tpdf is a primitive LaTeX version control system combining pdflatex and bibtex

1. move the program file to ~/bin (or wherever you store bash scripts)

2. instead of running pdflatex, do this:

	tpdf <option> sample.tex placeholder.bib

	replace "sample.tex" with your .tex file, and "placeholder.bib" with your .bib file (if you have one)
	replace "<option>" with "-n" if you don't want to date/timestamp your files and just want tpdf to run pdflatex and bibtex in the current directory

3. tpdf will create a datestamped folder in the working directory, and a timestamped folder in the datestamped folder
4. tpdf will copy the .tex file (timestamping it) into the timestamped directory
5. tpdf will run pdflatex on the copied .tex file
6. if you indicated a .bib file, tpdf will copy it to the timestamped folder and run bibtex
	6a. tpdf will ask if you want to run pdflatex once more to clean up \refs
7. tpdf will ask to run pdflatex once more to clean up \refs (if you didn't have a .bib file) and /cites (if you did)

(pressing [return] is equivalent to [y] in response to prompts.)
