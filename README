tpdf version 0.035

tpdf is a primitive LaTeX version control system combining pdflatex and bibtex

running tpdf:

$ tpdf <options> file.tex file.bib

options:	-b
				run BibTeX as well as pdfLaTeX
				if this option is selected without a file.bib file specified,
				tpdf will look in your local texmf/bibtex/bib directory
				
			-n
				'normal' mode---tpdf just runs pdfLaTeX and BibTeX (if selected)
				without making time- and date-stamped directories
				
tpdf creates a datestamped folder in the working directory,
and a timestamped folder in the datestamped folder.

tpdf copies the .tex file (timestamping it) into the timestamped directory
then runs pdflatex on the copied .tex file

If you indicated a .bib file, tpdf will copy it to the timestamped folder and run BibTeX
tpdf asks if you want to run pdfLaTeX once more to clean up \refs

Whether or not BibTeX is run, tpdf will ask to run pdfLaTeX once more.
