tpdf version 0.04

tpdf is a LaTeX frontend that combines pdflatex and bibtex

running tpdf:

tpdf <options> file.tex file.bib

		-b
		--bibtex
			run BibTeX as well as pdfLaTeX
			if this option is selected without a file.bib file specified,
			tpdf will look in your local texmf/bibtex/bib directory
			
		-s
		--stamp
			tpdf makes time- and date-stamped directories
			
		-c
		--clean
			tpdf removes old stamped PDFs (but leaves the source files)
			
		short options can be combined (e.g., -bsc, -cbs, -bs)
				
If stamp mode is on, tpdf creates a datestamped folder in the
working directory, and a timestamped folder in the datestamped folder.

tpdf copies the .tex file (timestamping it) into the timestamped directory
then runs pdfLaTeX on the copied .tex file

If you indicated a .bib file, tpdf will copy it to the timestamped folder and run BibTeX
tpdf asks if you want to run pdfLaTeX once more to clean up \refs

Whether or not BibTeX is run, tpdf will ask to run pdfLaTeX once more.

(pressing <return> is equivalent to "y" in response to prompts.)
